To install the dependencies, use one of `yarn install` or `npm install`; if needed, use
`brew install <yarn or npm>`. 

To run the application, either `yarn start` or `npm start` (depending on what you used earlier!) can be used. Then head to http://localhost:3000

### Backend
From the root of the project, `cd backend` to get into backend.
