# Technologies:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) ([React](https://reactjs.org/))

# Setup

Both the frontend and backend are implemented in this repository in the ``frontend`` and ``backend`` directories respectively, and can be set up independently as outlined below

## Frontend

To install the dependencies, run: 

```sh
$ cd frontend
$ yarn install
```

To run the application, run: 
```sh
$ yarn start
```

Then head to http://localhost:3000 on a browser to see the frontend!

## Backend

To create a virtual environment and install dependencies, run:
```sh
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate # Unix-like systems
$ source venv/Scripts/activate # Windows
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once you have tehse dependencies set up, you can  run the backend. To run the flask application that interfaces with our CockroachDB database:

```sh
$ python -m flask run
```

The part of our project that actually interfaces with the AdHawk SDK is in `backend/src/main.py`. To run, you must first install the AdHawk vision SDK, which is outside the scope of this readme but see [here](https://www.adhawkmicrosystems.com/api_doc) for documentation. Once that is running, simply call 

```sh
$ python ./main.py
```
And events will start being streamed to the CockroachDB database.
